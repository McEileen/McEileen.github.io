    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Born, raised, and schooled in the DC area, Eileen is excited to continue her education at Dev Bootcamp.  As a former legal aid paralegal, Eileen has ample experience with acronyms and is excited to continue using them in the tech world.  When not programming, she enjoys doing yoga, reading and people-watching.  She once dropped her camera into a waterfall in Ecuador after rappelling down aforementioned waterfall.  The camera still works, and Eileen likes to view it as a reminder of the importance of resilience.</p>
