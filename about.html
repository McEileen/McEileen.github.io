    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        Eileen is a current student at the Recurse Center, where she focuses her time on web app development and machine learning with feelings.  She has worked as a software developer on a variety of projects, using Java/Spring, TypeScript, and AWS.  With a background in legal aid, Eileen remains involved in civic tech projects, such as <a href="https://openoversight.com/">OpenOversight</a>.  When not programming, she enjoys doing yoga, reading, and people-watching.  She once dropped her camera into a waterfall in Ecuador after rappelling down aforementioned waterfall.  The camera still works, and Eileen likes to view it as a reminder of the importance of resilience.
