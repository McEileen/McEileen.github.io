      Monday was both exhilarating and tiring.  The Spring 2 batch started today, and I know it's cliche to say this, but I really can't believe how quickly the first six weeks of Recurse went.  I remain glad that I joined the community, and I'm excited to work with the new Recursers.

      Since I spent a lot of Monday doing first day of batch activities, I didn't cross as many things off my to-do list as usual.  That's fine, because I really do want to get to know the new Recursers.  I did finalize my resume and review my study plan for "Cracking the Coding Interview."  It's going to be a busy six weeks!  #NeverGraduate
