    Back in week four I was struggling to answer a methods question that gave errors no matter what I did.  At that point I still felt timid asking question on the GooglePlus community, and so I emailed my friends Erik, a DBC grad, and Rene, another friend I met at a weekly hack night.  Below is the email I sent.
  </p>
  <p>
    Hi Rene, I have a challenge that is asking me to create a method called my_array_finding_method that accepts an array and a letter as arguments then returns a new array of the words that contains that letter.  For example:
  </p>
  <p>
    my_array_finding_method(i_want_pets, "t")
  </p>
  <p>
    #=> should return ["want","pets","but"]
  </p>
  <p>
    I AM STUCK.  SO, SO STUCK.  Here are multiple solutions that I have tried
  </p>
  <p>
    Second failed solution that I did more recently
  </p>
  <p>
    # def my_array_finding_method(source, thing_to_find)
  </p>
  <p>
    #  new_array = []
  </p>
  <p>
    #  source.each do |e|
  </p>
  <p>
    #    new_array.push e.include?(thing_to_find.to_s) if e.include?(thing_to_find.to_s)
  </p>
  <p>
    #  end
  </p>
  <p>
    # end
  </p>
  <p>
    Earlier failed solution
  </p>
  <p>
    #def my_array_finding_method(source, thing_to_find)
  </p>
  <p>
    #  new_array = []
  </p>
  <p>
    #  source.each {|e| e.include_all(thing_to_find)}
  </p>
  <p>
    #    if e.include_all(thing_to_find)
  </p>
  <p>
    #      new_array.push(e)
  </p>
  <p>
    #    else
  </p>
  <p>
    #    end
  </p>
  <p>
    #  return new_array
  </p>
  <p>
    #end
  </p>
  <p>
    And you probably wonder what my errors are......  This is for the more recent attempted solution.
  </p>
  <p>
    1) PERSON 1: my_array_finding_method selects all words with a 't' in the original order
  </p>
      <p>
       Failure/Error: expect(my_array_finding_method(i_want_pets, "t")).to eq ["want","pets","but"]
      </p>
      <p>
       NoMethodError:
      </p>
      <p>
         undefined method `include?' for 3:Fixnum
     </p>
     <p>
       # ./my_solution.rb:12:in `block in my_array_finding_method'
    </p>
       # ./my_solution.rb:11:in `each'
    <p>
       # ./my_solution.rb:11:in `my_array_finding_method'
    </p>
    <p>
       # ./methods_spec.rb:8:in `block (2 levels) in <top (required)>'
    </p>

    <p>
      2) PERSON 1: my_array_finding_method selects all words with an 'a' in the original order
    </p>
        <p>
         Failure/Error: expect(my_array_finding_method(i_want_pets, "a")).to eq ["want","have"]
        </p>
        <p>
         NoMethodError:
        </p>
        <p>
           undefined method `include?' for 3:Fixnum
        </p>
        <p>
         # ./my_solution.rb:12:in `block in my_array_finding_method'
        </p>
        <p>
         # ./my_solution.rb:11:in `each'
        </p>
        <p>
         # ./my_solution.rb:11:in `my_array_finding_method'
        </p>
        <p>
         # ./methods_spec.rb:12:in `block (2 levels) in <top (required)>'
        </p>

      <p>
        I don't understand why I am getting the undefined method for include?  I get this even when I include .to_s to convert what it's receiving into a string.  I also tried other methods, like include, has_value and find, but none worked.
      </p>
    <p>
      Any wisdom would be appreciated.  (I also realize that this is not code clinic and if you can't help, okey doke.)
    </p>
    <p>
      THANK YOU, RENE.
    </p>

  <p>
    I did several things right in this question to my friend.  I started out by succinctly explaining the challenge, and I then showed two solutions that I had attempted.  I also expressed politeness and gratitude.  I showed due diligence by telling Rene that I had tried to use .to_s to convert what include? was receiving into a string.  I further demonstrated due diligence by telling I had tried other methods, like has_value and find.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, I think the layout of my email was somewhat unclear.  It would have flowed better if I pasted the errors immediately below the solutions that raised them.
  </p>
  <p>
    Rene responded and confirmed that I was running into problems because the method include? only works on strings.  He then helped me find the right answer.  I was very grateful for his help.
