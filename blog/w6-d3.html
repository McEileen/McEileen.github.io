      I did a variety of things today at Recurse, which is a nice change from the days where I go deep on a persistent bug.  (I'm looking at you, <a href="w6-d1.html">environment-specific</a> <a href="w6-d2.html">bugs</a> in OpenOversight.)  Since I'm almost halfway through Recurse, I'm now starting to look ahead to job hunting.  Today I started looking at interview prep strategy, and I also made major revisions to my resume.

      On a more communal note, I organized a personal website jam for recursers to get together and work on our personal websites together.  It was helpful to hear others' opinions on big-picture decisions, like font or color palette choices.  I'm not planning on deploying my revisions until I have them a bit more nailed down, but I made major changes to my website's images and landing page.  I also updated the color scheme so that it feels more current.  We're meeting again next week, and I'm excited to keep working together.

      Finally, I responded to feedback on a pull request that I recently submitted to OpenOversight.  I'm glad to be working on new contributions now that I've vanquished the environment-specific bugs.  Onward!
