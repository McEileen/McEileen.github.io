  <h1>Third Week of RC</h1>
  <h2>Day 4: Public Speaking is a lot like hot sauce</h2>
  <h4>March 7, 2019</h4>

        My first year out of college, I lived with a housemate, Katie, who put hot sauce on everything.  Rice, toast, her morning apple, everything.  I also started to eat more hot sauce while I was living with Katie, and I found that my tolerance for it increased faster than expected.  After a few months, I, too, enjoyed hot sauce on my toast.

        My second year out of college, I worked for the Affordable Care Act (ACA) as an in-person counselor, which meant that I enrolled clients in health insurance and did educational outreach on health reform.  Outreach required me to regularly do public speaking, and I quickly became used to speaking in front of groups, including those who didn't always love the ACA.  Sure, I sometimes got nervous, but it wasn't much of an issue.

        It's been years since I lived with Katie, and since that time, my tolerance for hot sauce has decreased.  Similarly, I no longer have a job that includes regular public speaking, and I do feel that my attitude about it has shifted.  I presented on debugging dockerized applications this Thursday at Recurse, and I could tell that I was more nervous than I used to get during ACA presentations.  However, I know that in the same way tolerance for spicy food can come back, ease with public speaking can come back.  I appreciated the opportunity to practice public speaking with a five minute talk, and I plan to do more in the future.
