  <h2>Day 2: i3 SkillShare</h2>
  <h4>March 19, 2019</h4>

      When I switched from Mac OSX to Ubuntu in November 2018, I wanted to find a tool that would replace <a href="https://github.com/fikovnik/ShiftIt">ShiftIt</a>, my old favorite tool for window management in Mac OSX.  Friends from Lucy Parsons Labs recommended i3, and I've been using it since.

      Today at Recurse, a group of us got together to do an i3 skillshare for about an hour.  We started by pulling up <a href="https://i3wm.org/docs/keyboard-layer1.png">the keyboard map for i3</a> and demo-ing some example commands.  I learned that when a roomful of recursers is instructing you to try out different commands for splitting the screen, one of the hardest parts is agreeing on the difference between a horizontal and vertical split.

        We also tried out the floating mode, which I still like less than sticking with a tiled layout.  However, I was excited to learn that if you put a window in floating mode, then right click on the floating window while holding down your mod key, you can resize the window.  Thanks, recursers, for all the tiling manager TILs.
