        This week I’m going to write a short blog that summarizes something I learned each day at Recurse.  I’m not promising that the blogs will be posted the day of (hello, Monday blog that is going up on a Tuesday!)  but I am excited to try this new format.

        I’m organizing a book club at Recurse where we meet weekly to discuss one or two chapters from “Working Effectively with Legacy Code” by Michael Feathers.  The goal was to read a book that didn’t require background with a specific technical stack, and which has lessons that we can all apply to future projects.  Also, I’d been wanting to read Feathers’ book since a mentor recommended it to me.

        Yesterday I read the first two chapters, “Changing Software” and “Working with Feedback.”  I was particularly struck by Chapter 2’s succinctly phrased “Legacy Code Change Algorithm”.  “When we change code, we should have tests in place.  To put tests in place, we often have to change code.”

        In order to write tests that enable larger, more structural code refactors and improvements, developers might first change code by breaking dependencies.  This particular example reminded me of my first job as a Java developer, when our team debated whether to use constructor injection or autowired dependencies.  We initially used autowiring, but switched to constructor injection because we felt it made it easier to see when our classes were acquiring excessive numbers of dependencies.  Transitioning from autowiring to constructor injection took some on a Refactor Friday, but it was worth it, and did make testing easier.  I’m excited to see what other Recursers thought of “Legacy Code,” including their thoughts on how it applies to their past projects.
