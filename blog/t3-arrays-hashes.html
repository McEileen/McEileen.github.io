      Arrays and hashes have several similarities, but they serve different uses.  Arrays and hashes are both ordered collections of objects that can include a variety of objects.  That means any ruby object can be in an array or hash, whether it is another array, a hash, a class, an integer or the binary values of true and false.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hashes are distinct from arrays because they store objects in pairs, wherein each pair has a key and a value.  A key can lead to more than one value, but a value can’t have more than one key.

      Since hashes store information in pairs, they would be good for storing information that is linked together, such as usernames and passwords, math problems and their answers or students’ names and their grade averages.  (Obviously, sensitive information such as passwords or grades should be stored in the safest, most secure way possible.)  Here is an example of a hash.

      Arrays are simpler because they don’t store information in pairs.  Arrays would be ideal for storing information that doesn’t need to have another piece of information associated with it, like names.
