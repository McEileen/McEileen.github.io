  <h1>Seventh Week of RC</h1>
  <h2>Day 3: This and That, Plus a Pointed Question</h2>
  <h4>April 3, 2019</h4>

        Tuesday night I did a mock interview with a Recurse alum, which reminded me of both the importance of recursion and relationships.  Recursion, because it often yields a more elegant solution than iteration, though calling a function within a function can put a strain on the stack.  Relationships, because the relationships within the Recurse community have invited me into a strong support network.  I am deeply grateful.

        Wednesday feels like a weird day to write a blog about, because I worked on a hodge-podge of assignments.  I also didn't accomplish as much as I wanted to do, but I think I may have been overly ambitious in the amount that I assigned myself.  It happens.
    </p>

        I started the day by doing front-end styling on EmoRepy, which went well.  I didn't start the slides for my presentation on EmoReply, but I can do them tomorrow or Friday.  The slides shouldn't take long.
    </p>
    <p>
        Since we've worked on both the front-end and back-end of EmoReply, we're now ready to connect the two.  I worked today on the API calls, and got inspiration from the fourth step of this tutorial, <a href="https://scotch.io/tutorials/build-a-chrome-extension-for-real-time-price-tracking-with-appbase">"Implement the Logic."</a>  While writing my ajax calls, I hit a "File not found" error where my code couldn't locate the jquery library I had imported into <code>popup.html</code>  I also realized that I had forgotten to import the ajax library, but that didn't resolve the "File not found" error from the jquery library.  I did my googles, and most people who encountered similar errors with the jquery library had made a typo in the library's class path.  In this case, I know I didn't make a typo.  The investigation shall continue tomorrow!

        I organized the second "Personal Website Jam" this afternoon.  It was exciting to welcome participants from the new batch, as well as returnees from last week.  One of my batchmates had attended last week and didn't have a personal website at that point.  She now has a website that she made with a template.  Yay for progress!

        I haven't yet deployed my personal website changes, but today I added the pdf of my resume to my website.  I'm still having a hard time centering the pdf viewer on the page.  I also did a major revision to the file structure and naming scheme of the website, which should make things much easier to maintain.  Finally, I decided to use Formplug for the contact form on my website, which I'm planning on building at the next work session.  It's been awhile since I worked with Serverless, so I'm excited to get back into it!
    </p>
    <p>
        After the personal website jam I spent more quality time with "Cracking the Coding Interview."  Today I reviewed the Java chapter, which made me feel warm and fuzzy inside.

        At the end of the day I started looking into an i3 bug.  Last week the shortcut to open a terminal, <code>Mod4 + Return</code>, randomly stopped working on my computer.  I honestly have no idea what caused this bug, especially since I haven't touched my i3 config file since installing i3.  I did quite a few googles on this bug, but I couldn't find anyone who had the shortcut stop working several months after they had installed i3.  Instead, I found a few people who had recently installed i3 and from the start were not able to use the <code>Mod4 + Return</code> shortcut.  For that situation, some commenters had suggested re-installing <code>i3-sensible-terminal</code>, which is what the <code>Mod4 + Return</code> shortcut points toward.  Frustratingly, none of the people suggesting this approach actually included instructions for how to reinstall <code>i3-sensible-terminal</code>.  I also found some questions about how to use a different terminal than <code>i3-sensible-terminal</code>, but I don't want to change the terminal.  I just want to be able to open the terminal!
    </p>
    <p>
        So many questions.  May further work and investigation bring answers.

i3 Struggles:
- For some reason the shortcut I use to open terminal (Mod4 + Return) has stopped working. I need to keep investigating this.
