      I spent most of today reading through <u>Cracking the Coding Interview</u> and doing practice problems.  My brain hurts a little, but I feel more prepared for interviews, so that's good.  One of the topics I feel less familiar with is bit manipulation, in part because I've never been asked about it in any previous interviews.  Here's a helpful video that I watched about bit manipulation, which also features Gayle Laakman MacDowell, author of <u>Cracking the Coding Interview.</u>
