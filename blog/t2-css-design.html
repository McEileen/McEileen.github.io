  <h2>Relative, Absolute and Fixed Positioning</h2>

      Relative positioning causes elements to behave as you would anticipate.  They will follow normal flow.  If two relatively positioned elements are next to each other, they will stack on top of each other.  Relative elements are different from static elements because they have offset properties.
    </p>
    <p>
        The absolute position property causes an element to remove itself from the normal flow.  No matter where you put this element, it will not be affected by other elements in the flow.  Similarly to relatively positioned elements, absolutely positioned elements respond to offset properties.
    </p>
    <p>
        A fixed position element has all the same properties of an absolutely positioned element, such as not following normal flow.  Also, the viewport, which means the browser or device window, such as the smartphone screen, determines where the fixed element is positioned.    On top of that, a fixed element does not scroll with the document.  It instead stays in its place.
