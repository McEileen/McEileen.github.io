  <h2>Day 4: Debugging a Containerized Application</h2>
  <h4>February 28, 2019</h4>

    <p>
      Debugging a containerized application differs slightly from debugging an app running on my local machine, but after a few quick googles, I feel up to the challenge.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, how to access logs for a docker container?  I started by typing `docker ps` into the terminal to see what docker images were running.

    <p>
      After finding the container id of the web container, I run `docker logs ${container_id}` to see the relevant logs.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what reading the logs isn’t enough to pinpoint a problem?  What if I want to initiate a debugger session with pdb?
    </p>
    <p> 
      In that case, I made a few changes to my `docker-compose.yml` so that I can run the app in debug mode and use pdb as needed.  I added the below lines to the dockerfile.
    </p>
    <code>
      stdin_open: true
      tty: true
    </code>
    <p>
      Next, I run `docker attach ${container_id}` in the terminal and navigate to the app in localhost.  I’m now able to see the logs output as the app runs.  Even better, I can drop a breakpoint in the code and then run pdb commands such as `list` or `next` once the program hits the breakpoint.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here’s a breakpoint I put in the code to create a new officer.

      And here’s a view of the pdb session open in terminal.
