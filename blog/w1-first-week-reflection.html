  <h1>First Week of RC</h1>
  <h2>Mutualism</h2>
  <h4>February 25, 2019</h4>

  <section>
    <p>
      When I first applied to RC, one of the things that most appealed to me was becoming part of a reciprocal community of learners.  While RC is a self-directed learning environment, it is anything but self-centered.  We all have the opportunity to learn from and collaborate with other students, who often have wildly different areas of interest and expertise.  I’ve already met RC-ers who work with tools and languages I had never previously encountered, such as shaders, Rust, and more.

      Admittedly, I did feel intimidated when I read through an introductions email thread before starting at Recurse.  I texted a friend, “Everyone is so cool and has worked with so many technologies.  I’m trying to reframe this and be excited about getting to work with all of them, instead of feeling intimidated.  I still feel, in comparison, that I am just not that cool and impressive.”  He responded, “They all feel the same way.”

      It has been comforting to talk with other recursers and realize that, yep, my friend was right.  Recurse’s social rules, such as no feigned surprise, have also helped me with my initial self-consciousness.  Meanwhile, I’ve also been trying to view Recurse as a group of mutualistic symbiotic relationships, where we all benefit one another.

      In the spirit of celebrating mutual benefit, I’m sharing a few examples of what I learned and what I taught to other Recursers.  Enjoy!

      What I learned
    </p>  
    <li>
      <ul>
        • String interning: When there are multiple strings that are the same value, string interning will store only a single copy of this string.  I learned this term during the design patterns study group, when we discussed the flyweight pattern.
      </ul>
      <ul>
        • Htop: I installed this package, which is extremely similar to top.  Unsurprising, I know. However, htop allows you to search by command name.  This proved helpful when I had configured a second monitor to work on my vanilla ubuntu but wasn’t sure how to access the display settings from i3.  By running htop in my ubuntu session and searching for the relevant command name, I could see how to replicate the configurations in i3.
      </ul>
    </li>    
    <p>What I taught</p>  
    <li>
      <ul>
        • i3: While asking a fellow recurser for help debugging my multiple monitor woes, I introduced him to i3 and the power of xrandr.  When he asked me why I like i3, I opened with, “It makes me feel hardcore.”  Then I explained how i3 has sped up my workflow by allowing me to use the mouse less and quickly switch between different workspaces.  He might check out i3 next, which I’m glad to hear!
      </ul>
      <ul>
        • Object oriented principles: While pairing on a minesweeper game with a fellow Recurser, I explained how to decide if a method should be a class method or an instance method.  We were writing a `display_pins` method that would be determined by the game pieces in an individual row.  Since the method operated on a single minesweeper game and needed to access that individual game’s information, we made it an instance method.
      </ul>
    </li>  
    <p>I look forward to learning more next week!</p>
