  <h1>Eighth Week of RC</h1>
  <h2>Day 1: Bit Manipulation</h2>
  <h4>April 8, 2019</h4>

  <section>
    <p>
        Recursers regularly get together and work on interview problems during post-lunch prep, affectionately known as PLP, or "ploop".  Today I ran post-lunch prep, in part because I wanted to choose our daily topic: bit manipulation!  I didn't have much prior experience with bit manipulation, which is why I wanted a PLP focused on it.

        Since we were an odd group, I paired/tripled with two Recursers, Jamie and Brandon.  We worked on <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-number-with-alternating-bits/">Leetcode Problem 693: Binary Number with Alternating Bits</a>.  Given the task of finding if a positive integer has alternating bits, we came up with the below solution.

        <code>
                class Solution:
                def hasAlternatingBits(self, n: int) -> bool:
                    last_value = n & 1
                    while n is not 0:
                        n = n >> 1
                        next_value = n & 1
                        if last_value == next_value:
                            return False
                        last_value = next_value
                    return True
        </code>
