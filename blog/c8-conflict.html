  <h1>Emotions Felt During a Conflict</h1>
  <h2>Breaking It Down</h2>
  <h4>August 30, 2015</h4>

<section>
  <p>
    The summer before my senior year of college, I worked full-time for my college in a job that also provided housing.  I lived with three other women who worked in the same department, Emma, Nardos and Kelly.  Emma and I had been close friends before we lived together, but I hadn't met Nardos or Kelly.  I shared a room with Kelly, while Emma and Nardos lived next-door.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since Kelly was older than the rest of us and had previously lived in her own apartment, she had more possessions than the rest of us.  Kelly kept a lot of her boxes in the apartment living room.  This didn't bother me, because I didn't spend a lot of time in our living room and I have absolutely no interest in interior design.  However, it frustrated Emma, and I think I picked up on some of her emotion because we were good friends.  Meanwhile, I was dealing with extreme culture shock after returning from a liberation theology and simple living program in El Salvador to a private university in one of the US's most expensive neighborhoods.  I had identified regular yoga practice as a way to work through culture shock and feel less numb.

    One day I was getting ready to leave our apartment for yoga when Kelly asked me if I could help her carry boxes to her car for her impending move.  I felt extreme resistance to helping Kelly because it would have made me late to yoga and taken away my main coping mechanism for culture shock.  I had been looking forward to yoga all day and I didn't want to lose that special me-time.  I told Kelly that I couldn't help her because I was going to yoga.  She responded in an imploring tone, "please?????"
  </p>
  <p>
    I felt that I was caught in a tough place because Kelly had resisted my original no.  I didn't want to make myself vulnerable with her by explaining how important yoga was to my mental health, because we didn't know each other that well and I didn't feel comfortable opening up to her.  At the same time, I felt concerned about Kelly's opinion of me, because I had to continue living with her after this.  I also felt worried about coming off as selfish, because at that time in my life it was important to me not to be selfish.
  </p>
  <p>
    Figuring that I was not going to be able to get out of helping Kelly, I accepted that I would not make yoga that night.  I felt it would be logical to at least try to get something out of the situation, so I said, "Okay, in exchange, will you move your stuff out of the living room?"  Kelly then got very upset, which I was not expecting, and responded, "Fine, if you're going to issue ultimatums, never mind!"  I felt regretful that I had unintentionally upset her, and I told her it was fine, that I could help with the boxes.  She continued to repeat that she didn't actually want my help, and that I could go.  I then went to yoga and felt tearful during one pose, which is something for me, because I cry very rarely.
  </p>
  <p>
    Kelly and I never verbally discussed our spat afterward, and I unfortunately didn't take actually take any actions to resolve our conflict.  As you may have guessed from the last sentence, withdrawal is my coping mechanism on the circle of shame that was identified in one video we watched.  However, Emma was in the yoga class I attended that night, and while we walked back from yoga we both received a text message from Kelly that she would move the boxes out of the living room by the end of the day.  This would have been a good time for me to discuss the conflict with Emma, but I was feeling too emotionally wobbly to do so.  I can't remember if Emma noticed I was upset or if I volunteered the information to her.  However, she somehow picked up on my negative emotions, and I simply told her that I had had a bad day.
  </p>
  <p>
    If I could return to this conflict and act with more self-assuredness, I would stand my ground when telling Kelly that I could not help her move boxes to her car.  I would explain that I had been looking forward to yoga all day and that I would not be able to exercise at any other point in the day.  I would not emotionally divulge why yoga felt so important to me at that time in my life, because I know I wouldn't have felt comfortable doing so.  Also, I don't think that it would have been necessary for me to do that.  Since Kelly hadn't asked for my help in advance and we weren't close friends, I don't feel that there was an obligation for me to help her.  I would have appreciated it if she respected my time more.  I worry that the last few sentences put too much of the blame on Kelly.  I want to acknowledge that I was not direct in my communication with her, and if I could go back to the conflict after the point of Kelly rejecting my help, I would have initiated a conversation with her about the conflict.  Open communication with roommates is key.

    I struggled somewhat with writing the above paragraph, because although I am much more self-confident now, I don't think that I would have been able to take the above actions as an emotionally wobbly 21-year-old.    Instead, I would have struggled to assert my needs.  Analyzing the above experience did remind me of my tendency to withdraw, which I predict that I will do during times of stress at Dev Bootcamp.  I hope that being aware of my tendencies toward withdrawal will help me to cope in more fruitful manners, but again, I am doubtful.
