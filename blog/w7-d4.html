        I felt pretty under the weather today, and it definitely affected my engagement at Recurse.  I'm starting to think that I might not practice what I preach about practicing a mindset of fruitfulness over productivity.  Time for an explanatory tangent.
    </p>
    <p>
        When I was in college, my friend Jordan used to complain about when people would come back from the library and say, "I wasn't very productive."  "What are they trying to produce?"  Jordan said.  "We're not factories, we're students.  And we're not producing, we're learning."  (Jordan had just spent a very formative summer working on a back-to-the-land goat farm.)
    </p>
    <p>
        Another friend, Anna, countered, "A lot of the times when people go to the library, they have something specific to do.  Like, they might have to write a paper."
    </p>
    <p>
        Though I see Anna's point, I agree with Jordan's overall critique.  It's fine to focus on producing a paper or a presentation for a specific deadline, however, when students have an overall focus on productivity, it changes learning.  I worry that a focus on productivity can cause us to focus on quantity rather than quality.  In the last few years, I've tried to shift toward thinking of work and learning in terms of fruitfulness, not productivity.  Trees don't constantly produce fruit, and that's a good thing, because it would be crappy fruit.  Similarly, I don't constantly write code or learn new concepts.  It would be junky code!  When trees are in their growing season, they make delicious fruit, and when I'm in my nerdy equivalent of the growing season, I write code.
    </p>
    <p>
        (I recognize that the factory farming system and greenhouses strain this metaphor a bit.  Let a girl dream!  Let me imagine that all fruit trees come from somewhere just like Jordan's back-to-the-land goat farm.)
    </p>
    <p>
        Focusing on fruitfulness over productivity also requires me to practice self-compassion.  On days when I don't quite crush it, like today, I have to give myself a break.  Time to lay the fertilizer of self-forgiviness.  Pretty sure they don't use that at factory farms.

        So, today I wasn't as productive as I usually am at Recurse.  In the morning I worked on writing the API calls to connect EmoReply's front-end to the back-end.  Since my EmoReply partner and I haven't yet done the back-end machine learning portion, we are currently only coding the chrome extension to display a hard-coded response.  I spent quite some time on a bug where the chrome extension displays all of the code that generates the hard-coded response, instead of displaying the hard-coded response itself.  Sheesh.  Then in the afternoon I battled with debugging a dockerized app.  None of this was monumental, however, it was a day.  I am a determined little tree and I will do more tomorrow.
