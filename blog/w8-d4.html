  <h1>Eighth Week of RC</h1>
  <h2>Day 4: Bash and Leetcode</h2>
  <h4>April 11, 2019</h4>

  <section>
    <p>
      Today at post-lunch prep (PLP) we did a problem in bash, which was a PLP first for me.  The problem, <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-phone-numbers/">193. Valid Phone Numbers</a>, asked us to write a single-line bash expression to find valid phone numbers.  My pair and I started by using a few helpful websites, namely, <a href="www.regexr.com">www.regexr.com</a>, <a href="www.rubular.com">www.rubular.com</a>, and ye olde <a href="www.stackoverflow.com">www.stackoverflow.com</a>, to devise a regular expression that would match valid phone numbers.  See below for our solution.

    <pre>
      <code>
        while read -r line; do if [[ $line =~ ^(\([0-9]{3}\) |[0-9]{3}-)[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{4}$ ]]; then echo $line; fi; done < file.txt;
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      Disclaimer: Another Recurser came up with a faster solution by using grep instead of a while loop.  According to their explanation, grep is more efficient than while loops for searching multiple lines in a file.  Good to know!
