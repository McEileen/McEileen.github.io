  <h1>Regular Expressions</h1>

    A regular expression is a combination of characters that is used to identify a series of characters you are looking for.  How you define the series is almost universal across different languages, such as JavaScript or Ruby.
  </p>
  <p>
    A regular expression will always occur in between two forward slashes.  See below:
      <ul>
        <li>/RegExp/</li>
      </ul>
  </p>
    Just as there are multiple ways to construct a function or object, there are also two ways to create a regular expression.
  <p>
    Literal notation, which holds a pattern between two forward slashes, for example the below.
    <li>
      var example = /d/;
    </li>
  </p>
  <p>
    There is also the option of calling the constructor function of the RegExp object, as seen below.
    <li>
      var example = new RegExp("d");
    </li>
  </p>
  <p>
    The two methods of defining a regular expression are distinguished from one another by their compilation methods.  Regular expression literals will compile after the script is loaded, which means this is the preferred approach when the regular expression will not change.  However, the constructor function is the superior option when the regular expression pattern will not remain stable, because it provides runtime compilation of the regular expression.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you are trying to find a direct match, meaning an exact segment of text you would use a simple pattern, like the below:
    <li>/Spot/</li>
    When run on the phrase, "See Spot run," the above would return "Spot."  If it were run on the phrase "See Tops run," it would not return anything.  Even though the desired characters occur in the phrase it is run on, they are not in the needed order.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you wanted to find something a little more complicated, like a segment including white space, you would use special characters.  For example, a character that has a backslash before it should not be interpreted literally.  The regular expression /\d/ would match with any digit character, like 7 in the sentence, "My apartment is number 7."
