      At the end of <a href="../w6-d1.html">Monday</a> I was still struggling with an environment-specific bug in OpenOversight.  Two functional tests passed when I ran them in the docker environment, but they failed in the Travis build.  A fellow OpenOversight member created a VM to replicate the Travis CI build, and the tests also failed in the VM.  I reached out to a fellow OpenOversight team member who figured out that race conditions were causing the tests to fail.  The `.click()` in the test was async, which means that subsequent searches in the DOM were getting called with stale data.  The team member wrote a `wait_for_page_load()` context manager, which made the code wait until the DOM is refreshed, then wrapped the `.click()` calls in the `wait_for_page_load()` context manager, which made the code wait until the DOM is refreshed.  Now the tests pass and the PR is FINALLY ready for review.  Teamwork makes the dreamwork!
