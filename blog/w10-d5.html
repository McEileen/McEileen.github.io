  <h1>Tenth Week of RC</h1>
  <h2>Day 5: Two Weeks Left</h2>
  <h4>April 26, 2019</h4>

    <p>
      Confession: I haven't blogged for most of the last two weeks.  Since I need to catch up on blogs, and I also only have two weeks left at the Recurse Center (!), this seems like a good time to write more of a big-picture blog.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few weeks ago I was on a coffee chat with a fellow Recurser in my batch, T.  We were sitting on a bench in Ft. Greene Park, drinking nutella hot chocolate and watching small children climb trees.  ("Don't climb a tree unless you can get yourself out," said a supervising adult.  They mostly listened.)
    </p>
    <p>
      "What would you have done differently at Recurse?" T asked me.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think I have that many things I would have done differently,"  I said.  "I did have some projects I let go, but that's okay, because part of coming to Recurse was about letting myself explore things."
    </p>
    <p>
      But I also objected to the question.  "Asking that makes it sound like Recurse is over."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's true," T said.  "I guess whatever you wanted to do differently, you could just do it for the next four weeks."
    </p>
    <p>
      And so, what am I going to do, differently or otherwise, for the next two weeks?
    </p>
    <p>
      Overall, I feel really proud of how I've commmitted myself to Recurse.  I've made a lot of headway on OpenOversight, which was one of my main goals for the program.  As shown by this blog, I've also gotten better at tracking my measurable progress, which is a tactic that Julie Pagano recommends for <a href="http://juliepagano.com/blog/2013/11/02/it-s-dangerous-to-go-alone-battling-the-invisible-monsters-in-tech/">>combatting imposter syndrome</a>.  Like I said to T, I have stepped away from some work I was doing earlier in the program.  For example, I started out reading "Working Effectively with Legacy Code" by Michael Feathers, but I've stopped reading it in the last few weeks as I shifted to working on job applications.  Once I've finished applying to jobs, I plan on starting to read it again.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the next two weeks, I'm going to continue working on OpenOversight, with a few discrete goals for the rest of my time.  I need to refactor the upload images functionality, and  I'm hopeful that it shouldn't take too long.  I also want to make a front-end tweak that will display information about officers' incidents without requiring users to do a page reload.  Finally, and most excitingly, I'm gong to implement multifactor authentication.  When I'm not working on OpenOversight, I still need to finish building the Flask server for the back-end of the EmoReply chrome extension.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, I'm going to pair more during the next two weeks.  There aren't many people in my batch working with Python and Flask, which has made it tricky to find pairing partners for OpenOversight. However, pairing with people who were new to the tech stack reminded me of how much I enjoy pairing.  It's always valuable to talk through technical decisions with people who are new to a project, regardless of how well they know the relevant technologies.  Also, since there are only two weeks left of us being together, I'm trying to maximize the time I spend with other Recursers.  I'd say something cheesy, but that would make it sound like Recurse is over.  And clearly, I'm not ready for that.
