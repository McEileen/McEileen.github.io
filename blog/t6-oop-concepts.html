  <h2>When To Use What</h2>

      Class methods are methods that are defined on a class.  Class methods can be distinguished from other sorts of methods, such as instance methods, by their notation.  They generally are written with the name of the class, a : : as separator, and then the method itself.  For example, a class called Hamilton, with a method of calculate, would be written Hamilton::calculate.  An instance method would use a # as a separator, like Hamilton#calculate.

    <p>
      Class methods are relevant because certain functions that are related to class cannot be accomplished by individual instances of a class.  That’s why a class method sends a command to the class itself, rather than to one of the class’s instances.  Class methods are also important for me to understand because this weekend when I was working on my bingo solo challenge, I found that I kept getting an undefined method error for a method I was calling, even though it clearly existed.  I now recognize that I was attempting to call a class method on an instance.  I am going to go fix that now.
