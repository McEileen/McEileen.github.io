  <h2>This Stuff Worries Me</h2>
  <h4>August 2, 2015</h4>

  <p>
    It’s Sunday evening and I am sitting at my dining room table taking deep breathes.  I’m not trying to calm myself because I have a lot of Dev Bootcamp work due tomorrow, or because rent was due yesterday.  Instead, I am trying to calm down because I just finished doing research on internet security and I feel powerless.
  </p>
  <p>
    I had internet security on my mind after attending a presentation at Chi Hack Night by <a href=www.twitter.com/plussone> Rachael Perrotta, </a> who does public relations work for activism in Chicago.  Perrotta focused her talk on the <a href=www.twitter.com/traumacenternow> Trauma Care Coalition,</a> which advocates for the University of Chicago to open a trauma center and does much of its communication through twitter.  During the Q&A part of the event, one audience member asked how Perrotta’s clients respond to security threats and rightly noted that it isn’t hard to hack into a twitter account.  Perrotta responded by explaining cryptoparties, get-togethers where individuals become familiar with ways to protect their data and devices from outside surveillance.
  </p>
  <p>
    I remembered Perrotta’s talk when I read the recent news that  <a href=http://fusion.net/story/173048/black-lives-matter-monitored-department-homeland-security/> the Department of Homeland Security has been monitoring the Black Lives Matter movement.</a>  As noted in the linked article, the US government’s history of practicing surveillance on activist movements means that this news really isn’t a surprise.  However, the commonness of publicizing direct actions through social media, as well as activists’ tendency to communicate through technology, adds a new dimension to an old problem.  I had also been considering security threats since the nonprofit I worked at before Dev Bootcamp had an information security training about how we can best protect our clients’ information.  I am concerned about how I will integrate my own dedication to social change into my new life as a software developer, and helping activists with security seems like a natural path.  Consequently, I decided to learn more about cryptoparties.
  </p>
  <p>
    The first site that came up when I googled cryptoparties, www.cryptoparty.in, described them as “a decentralized, global initiative to introduce the most basic cryptography software and the fundamental concepts of their operation to the public.”  I can get behind that!  Chicago’s own South Side Hacker Space recently had a cryptoparty in July, but I couldn’t find any upcoming ones in Chicago.  However, I did learn that I shouldn’t have googled cryptoparty, and that https://startpage.com offers a more secure search engine.  I started to get overwhelmed while reading through what www.cryptoparty.in called <a href=https://www.cryptoparty.in/learn/how-tos a “brief” how-to,</a> and I decided to instead start out by choosing a password manager.
  </p>
  <p>
    While my organization’s information security training advised us to use password managers, our IT specialist also acknowledged that major password manager, LastPass, was recently hacked.  Way to inspire confidence, buddy!  Interested in choosing a password manager, I read a <a href=http://lifehacker.com/5529133/five-best-password-managers> Lifehacker article that also recommended LastPass as a superior password manager.</a>  It’s wise to note that this article came out in January 2015, before <a href=http://www.wired.com/2015/06/hack-brief-password-manager-lastpass-got-breached-hard/>LastPass was hacked.</a>  After taking more deep breathes, I decided to try out KeePass, a free service that can be used locally or transported on a portable device, such as a thumb drive.  Using KeePass locally will protect me from the hacking threats that face password managers stored on the cloud.  I’m still anxious after reading about the various security and hacking threats that exist, but I’m trying to apply Dev Bootcamp’s mentality “done is better than perfect” to this new frontier.  Although I can’t guarantee complete security for myself or any group I serve, I can and will work toward more security.
