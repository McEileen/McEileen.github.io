  <h2>Response to Shereef's Fireside Chat</h2>

      After watching Shereef’s fireside chat, I feel reassured about my decision to enter DBC.  When he spoke about the “educational trauma that is in our bodies” of students constantly looking outward for the answer, it reminded me of the distinction between banking education and participatory learning.  I appreciate how DBC encourages us to work together to build our own knowledge, rather than swallowing it whole from an outside source.  I hear people criticize banking education in modern US schools by referring to it as industrial education, in which students are trained to be docile factory workers.  I was going to point out that manufacturing jobs are disappearing in the US and students would benefit from learning other skills.  Then I thought, self, maybe education shouldn’t just be about turning children into workers.

      Anyways.

      I don’t think my expectations for DBC have changed, because before enrolling in Phase 0 I was familiar with DBC’s pedagogical approach.  I am excited to learn in an environment that recognizes the whole person, since I think that is hard to find in US workplaces.  Of course, I have slight nerves about certain aspects of DBC and its culture.  I am a fairly introverted person, and sometimes I just need to sit in the corner and feel my internal battery recharge.  I am concerned that DBC’s heavy workload and emphasis on collaboration may make me time hard to find.  Luckily, I already have big plans for solo adventures during our lengthy lunch breaks!
