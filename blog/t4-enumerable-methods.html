I researched the method Enumerable#map.  Starting with Ruby docs, I learned that map will return a new array that shows the results of running block once for every element in the accepted array.  For example, suppose a teacher has realized that they graded a class's work too harshly, and they now want to add five points to every student's grade.  The below code represents how map could aid the teacher.

  class_grades = [67, 63, 72, 81, 77, 78, 55, 80, 71, 68]
  class_grades.map { |i| i + 5} #=> [72, 68, 77, 86, 82, 83, 60, 85, 76, 73]

Map is not a destructive method, which means that it will not change the array it was passed.  For example,  if we call the array class_grades after calling the above code, we will get

  p class_grades = [67, 63, 72, 81, 77, 78, 55, 80, 71, 68]

Adding a ! to the method will make it destructive and cause the array's values to change.
