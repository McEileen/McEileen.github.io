      Today I submitted a pull request to add the ability to enable, disable, and delete departments from OpenOversight.  Admins can do all of the previous behaviors to any department, whereas department area coordinators only have the ability to enable or disable their individual department.  Additionally, admins can edit departments, such as by changing the department name or abbreviation.  OpenOversight already had some of this existing functionality in place, but it wasn't centralized in a single location.  I created a `DepartmentsAPI`, which is displayed in a departments dashboard that only admins can access.  Meanwhile, area coordinators can will view a "Department" link within the website's top menu, which takes them to an enable/disable form for their individual department.

      I'm proud of myself for writing tests that were thorough and covered a variety of cases.  My first job stressed TDD, and I still place a lot of faith in tests.  That being said, I want to share some topics that I consider when trying to come up with thorough tests.
