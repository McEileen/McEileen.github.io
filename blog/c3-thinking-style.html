  <h1>Thinking on Thinking</h1>
  <h2>Some Words from An Abstract Random Thinking</h2>
  <h4>July 25, 2015</h4>

  My biggest struggle in Phase 0 has been keeping up with the workload.  It challenges me to balance my Phase 0 work with my full-time job, community involvement and my personal life.  I initially struggled with the workload because a system error prevented me from accessing the curriculum until a week and a half into Phase 0, but I have now succeeded at catching up.

  I had never heard of the Gregorc Thinking Style until starting Phase 0, but I was not surprised to find that I am an abstract random thinker.  A college housemate once called me “the queen of non sequiturs” and I know that I operate in a more free-wheeling way than most.  There were certain abstract random thinker traits that resonated with me, like my strong listening skills, but there were others that felt very different from me, like the inability to explain or justify feelings.  I suppose this shows that we are all a mix of different styles.

  While contemplating how understanding my learning style can ease my progress through Phase 0, I zoned in on certain advice from this page https://aae.boisestate.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Anthony-Gregorc-4-Mind-Styles.pdf, like “recognize how strongly emotions influence your concentration” and “be careful to allow enough time to finish the job.”  When I first started working in legal aid in Chicago, I realized that an unhealthy tendency to get down on myself when I made a mistake in turn caused me to become so upset that I couldn’t concentrate on work.   I’ve trained myself out of this behavior at the office, and I plan on applying the same awareness to Dev Bootcamp.  I’ve also realized that I am much fresher at the beginning of the day, which I think is because daily frustrations have not yet begun to weigh me down.  Finally, I note that I don’t always excel at managing my time, and sometimes I get hung up on one task rather than considering the big picture.  I will try to address this issue by timing myself more often when I work.

  I fell deeply in love with the distinction between fixed and growth mindsets when I first learned about it, and I am happy to see how Dev Bootcamp incorporates this concept into its pedagogy.  Since I have worked in a lot of linear workplaces, I sometimes feel insecure about my own free-spirited nature.  I think it’s important for me to remember that just as I can develop better Ruby skills, I can also develop better time management skills.  I look forward to taking on both challenges during Dev Bootcamp.
