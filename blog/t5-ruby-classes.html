      As I rode the el under the Chicago River this weekend, I reflected on how it would be nice to ride a boat on said river.  That is how I came up with the idea of designing a Chicago River boat class.

      All boats should have certain characteristics in order to keep passengers safe.  In the case of capsizing, life vests are essential to keep folks alive.  Safety belts are also a vital need.  As a result, life vests and safety belts are class variables.

      Class methods will include all boat functions, such as float and launch from dock.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instance methods will depend on what type of boat it is.  For example, a Chicago river tour boat will include the method of charging customers because that is required for the business to stay afloat.  A yacht will not include this method, because such boats are already financially solvent.
    </p>

      Instance variables will also depend on the type of boat.  For example, a speedboat will have a much faster speed variable than a Chicago river tour boat.
