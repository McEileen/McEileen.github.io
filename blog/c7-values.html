  <h1>My Values</h1>
  <h2>Pushing Back on Stereotype Threat</h2>
  <h4>August 19, 2015</h4>

    The times I think of as being happiest, proudest and most satisfied were actually all quite difficult and trying, in a sense, but very rewarding.  I think of studying abroad at La Casa de la Solidaridad and doing JVC in Nashville.  I’m not sure if this reflects that life in general is difficult and trying, or if I particularly like difficult and trying times.
  </p>
  <p>
    The values I lived in my happiest, proudest or most satisfied times, selected from the below table
  </p>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Activism</li>
      <li>Adventure</li>
      <li>Challenge</li>
      <li>Close Relationships</li>
      <li>Community</li>
      <li>Compassion</li>
      <li>Friendships</li>
      <li>Growth</li>
      <li>Helping others</li>
      <li>Justice</li>
      <li>Persistence</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

    I value community after living in intentional community during a post-graduate service year and a liberation theology study abroad program in El Salvador.  One of my service year support people, Louisa, had done the same service year and once commented that she found living in community helpful because she was the kind of person who typically avoided difficult conversations, but she enjoyed living in community because it encouraged her to have those difficult conversations.  I also appreciate that realness and mutual growth which comes from community.  Furthermore, community challenges the individualism that is woven into US dominant culture.

    My friend Alison last asked me for advice when we discussed her decision to potentially move from Nashville to a new city.  Alison has lived in Nashville for three years, since graduating from college, and she still doesn’t feel socially connected here.  At this point, she feels that she has tried and should just move already.  Her request for advice fit with my values because I advised her to move onto a place where she will be happier and find more community.  We discussed ways she can seek out a new community, like looking for somewhere she already has connections or inroads into a new support system.

    I am not entirely certain how I feel when I reflect on my values.  On the one hand, it’s comforting to know I have a core of conviction within me that propels me and what I do.  On the other hand, some of my values are so important to me and so woven into my worldview that I struggle to articulate them.  It’s like someone asking me why I had brown hair.  I just do.  It comes out of my head like that.

    I would love to say that reflecting on my values fills me with a warm and fuzzy feeling of sureness that will beat back any stereotype threat that I may encounter during Dev Bootcamp.  Unfortunately, this is not the case.  I’m not sure what other exercises I can use to help myself address stereotype threat when I feel it.  I did get a lot of comfort from watching Claude Steele’s talk about stereotype threat at Columbia.  Consequently, I will pursue learning more about stereotype threat, because I think that will help me to push back on its force.
