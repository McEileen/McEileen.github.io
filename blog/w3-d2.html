        Before starting at the Recurse Center, I knew that I wanted to work on multiple projects.  I'm a big believer in productive procrastination.  (I'm also a big believer in a paradigm of fruitfulness, rather than productivity, but that's a topic for a different blog.) Productive procrastination means that when I don't feel like working on one thing, or if I'm stuck on a project, I'll work on another project.  Then, when I get tired of that project, I return to the earlier project.  I frequently find that I'm able to make headway on the first project after taking a break from it.

        Though I'm focusing on OpenOversight while at the Recurse Center, I'm also currently working on EmoReply, a project that began as a parody of Gmail's exclamation-mark-laden autoresponses.  EmoReply replaces the exclamation marks with tear marks, giving you angst-laden autoreplies.

        I'm working on EmoReply with a recurser currently in the second half of his batch, Jamie, who also happens to have more experience with Python than I do.  Since I still frequently find myself thinking in Ruby while working in Python, I've appreciated pairing as a way to learn more of Python's fun quirks.  Here's a grab-bag of ways that Python differs from Ruby:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Python doesn't use end statements for methods
        </li>
        <li>
            In Python, indentation is required to indicate what block of code a statement belongs to.  Not so in Ruby.
        </li>
        <li>
            Methods in Python open with a colon, like the below.
        </li>
            <code>
                def sample_python_method:
            </code>
        <li>
            In Ruby, methods look like so, without a colon.
        </li>
            <code>
                def sample_ruby_method
            </code>
        <li>
            In Python, in order to find the length of an array, <code>sample_object</code>, you call <code>len(sample_object)</code>
        </li>
        <li>
            In Ruby, in order to find the length of an array, <code>sample_object</code>, you call <code>sample_object.length</code>
        </li>
    </ul>
