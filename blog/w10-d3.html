  <h2>Day 3: Talking About Imposter Syndrome</h2>
  <h4>April 24, 2019</h4>

      This morning at the Recurse Center, one of my batchmates, J, facilitated an event called, "Squash Imposter Syndrome & Rewire Self-Limiting Beliefs."  J had attended a workshop with the same title, and she wanted to share what she had learned with other Recursers.

      In the past, I've taken some issues with conversations around imposter syndrome.  I worry that some discussions focus on teaching affected individuals how to handle imposter syndrome, rather than changing tech into an industry that doesn't cause members of underindexed groups to feel imposter syndrome.  That being said, I know that imposter syndrome affects me, and I was interested to hear what J had to say.

      During the workshop, J had us write down a belief, thought, feelings, physiology, and behavior that stems from imposter syndrome.  At the bottom of the page, we wrote down what society would look like if everyone behaved this way.  For that prompt, I initially wrote, "Geez," then followed it up with "very little collaboration or knowledge-sharing."  Previously, I had thought about how imposter syndrome negatively affected myself and groups I work with, but I had never considered it at the society level.  That prompt was sobering.

      Next, we broke up into pairs and talked with our partner about what we had written.  It was comforting to hear someone else express similar woes, and especially because I had perceived my partner as a more experienced engineer.  After talking in pairs, we flipped the paper over and wrote a positive, reframed version of the opposite side.  Finally, we got back into pairs and talked about how we had reframed our self-limiting beliefs.

      Here are two talks about imposter syndrome, <a href="http://juliepagano.com/blog/2013/11/02/it-s-dangerous-to-go-alone-battling-the-invisible-monsters-in-tech/">one by Julie Pagano</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEV_r9MKNO8">one by Tiffany Dockery</a>, which I later shared with the group via zulip.  They both proposed techniques that help me, such as tracking measurable progress.  (Confession: That advice is part of why I'm blogging about Recurse.)
