  <h1>Feedback</h1>

    It’s hard for me to make any sort of general or summarizing statement about the experience of pair-programming because it varies so much session by session.  Sometimes pair programming takes far less time than expected and we both end it in a happy place.  Other times my pair and I have gotten stuck and agreed to finish it on our own afterward.  I find it particularly fun and rewarding when my pair and I get to teach each other new tricks and techniques.  I always make a note of it when my pair explains a new method to me.  I find it very difficult when I feel that I am not contributing to the session or holding up my end of the work.  When I really struggle with this tendency, I find that the amount of time I spend worrying about my performance actually distracts me from programming and distances me from my pair.  I am trying to work on this by looking up new techniques more proactively and letting my pair know when I am confused.    </p>

    At first I felt antsy when I read my feedback, I think because I read all of it at once.  I am now much more used to it and I find the process of reading feedback incredibly helpful.  One thing that I find intriguing is how sometimes pairs who offer constructive feedback hedge a little bit and give a disclaimer beforehand about how they really enjoyed working with me, etc., but they have to give constructive feedback so (*insert feedback here*).  The disclaimers make me wonder if the pair is worried about hurting my feelings or offending me.  Often, their feedback is incredibly helpful and I am very glad to hear it.  No need for the disclaimer!

    Based on the feedback that I received, I am going to spend more time studying concepts and general implementations of Ruby concepts.  One of my pairs noted that I used examples a lot when I was pairing, and I sometimes wasn’t flexible in how I approached the process of using methods.  I appreciated this and will definitely be brushing up on my Ruby concepts.

    When I first wrote feedback, I wrote all of it at once and a few days after my pair sessions.  This proved challenging because I did not remember the sessions as well as I would have liked.  I shifted to writing feedback the day of or the day after pairing.  It’s much easier to give feedback this way because I remember our session more clearly.  It initially proved difficult for me to write feedback because I had overly high standards and worried that my feedback wouldn’t be helpful or thorough enough for my partners.  After reading feedback I had received, I realized that I often got great benefit from just one sentence in the feedback.  This helped me to lower my standards and approach the art of giving feedback in a more calm manner.

    Overall, I have a positive opinion of the process of using pairing and feedback to guide my learning.  I generally seek out feedback after a college internship when I had a negative experience due to a lack of feedback.  My supervisor and I did not communicate about expectations, and I consequently did not perform as either of us had desired.  Though this is a learning experience rather than a job, I still remain committed to getting feedback.
