  <h2>Day 3: Mistakes!</h2>

        Recurse has several needlepoint hangings upstairs that have Recurse-y sayings on them, such as "You can do a lot in a day," "Make mistakes," and "Ask Anything."  While I believe in the mottos, I sometimes have a hard time living them, particularly making mistakes, or admitting when I make mistakes.  So for today's blog, I'm going to admit that I took the wrong subway line today.  It happens.  (And, dang, did it happen for awhile.  That was a slow line.)
