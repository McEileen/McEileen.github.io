  <h2>Considering Version Control and Git</h2>

      Version control makes it easier to experiment with coding because if you make a mistake, you can back up to an earlier version of your work before you made the error.  Version control also makes it easier to collaborate because partners can copy one version of your work, edit it and then show their work to you without altering the original version.

        How does git help you keep track of changes?
        Git shows you snapshots of your work on a project.  You can see how different versions of your code function, or don't!
    </p>
    <p>
        Storing code on a remote repository like Github, rather than simply storing it in Git on your local repository, promotes collaboration with coders who don't know you.  Thanks to Github, someone you will never meet can feedback on your project or work with you.  Github encourages a vibrant and thriving open source community that shares knowledge with all.
